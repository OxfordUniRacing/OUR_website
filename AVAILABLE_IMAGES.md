When editing content in the Netlify CMS:

1. **For featured images**: Copy and paste the full path (e.g., `/images/general/team+photo.jpg`)
2. **For markdown content**: Use standard markdown syntax:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](/images/general/team+photo.jpg)
   ```
3. **For team member photos**: Use paths like `/images/team/member-name.jpg`
4. **For sponsor logos**: Use paths like `/images/sponsors/sponsor-name.png`

## Important Notes
