# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Oxford University Racing (OUR) website, a modern Next.js application built for the university's Formula Student team. The site uses a content management system (Decap CMS) for non-technical team members to manage content like news articles, team profiles, and sponsor information.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Deployment Workflow
**IMPORTANT: Always follow this sequence after making changes:**

1. **Test locally**: Run `npm run build` and `npm run type-check` to verify no errors
2. **Stage changes**: `git add .`
3. **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"`
4. **Push to repository**: `git push origin main`
5. **Monitor deployment**: Watch CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions and Vercel/Netlify
6. **Fix any failures**: If deployment fails, investigate and fix issues immediately

This ensures the site remains functional and all changes are properly deployed.


## Architecture & Tech Stack

### Framework & Core Technologies
- **Next.js 14** with App Router (not Pages Router)
- **TypeScript** with strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom Oxford University branding
- **Decap CMS** for content management (accessible at `/admin`)

### Content Management System
- Content is stored as Markdown files in the `content/` directory
- Uses gray-matter for frontmatter parsing
- Content types: news articles, team members, sponsors, static pages
- Content is organized by type and subteam for team members

### Key Directories
- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/` - React components organized by feature
- `content/` - Markdown content files organized by type
- `lib/` - Utility functions, types, and content fetching logic
- `public/` - Static assets including images and CMS admin
- `styles/` - Global CSS styles

## Content Architecture

### Team Structure
Team members are organized into subteams:
- `leadership` - Team leadership and management
- `aerodynamics` - Aerodynamics and CFD team
- `chassis` - Chassis design and manufacturing
- `powertrain` - Engine and drivetrain systems
- `electronics` - Electronics and control systems
- `operations` - Operations, logistics, and business

### Content Types
1. **Team Members** (`content/team/[subteam]/`)
   - Organized by subteam directories
   - Include profile info, bio, academic details
   - Support optional images, email, LinkedIn

2. **News Articles** (`content/news/`)
   - Support featured articles for homepage
   - Include metadata like tags, author, date
   - Can include featured images

3. **Sponsors** (`content/sponsors/`)
   - Simple system: name, logo, website, description
   - No tier system for easier management

4. **Static Pages** (`content/pages/`)
   - For content that doesn't fit other categories

## Key Files to Understand

### Content Management (`lib/content.ts`)
- `getTeamMembers()` - Fetches all team members
- `getTeamMembersBySubteam()` - Filters by subteam
- `getNewsArticles()` - Fetches news with sorting by date
- `getFeaturedNews()` - Gets featured articles for homepage
- `getSponsors()` - Fetches sponsors sorted alphabetically
- `markdownToHtml()` - Converts markdown to HTML using remark

### Type Definitions (`lib/types.ts`)
Contains comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:
- `TeamMember` - Team member data structure
- `NewsArticle` - News article structure
- `Sponsor` - Sponsor information
- `NavigationItem` - Site navigation structure

### Utilities (`lib/utils.ts`)
- `cn()` - Tailwind class merging utility
- `formatDate()` - Formats dates for UK locale
- Helper functions for text manipulation

## Design System & Branding

### Brand Colors (Tailwind Config)
- **Oxford Blue**: `#002147` (primary brand color)
- **Racing Red**: `#FF0000` (accent color)
- **Silver**: `#C0C0C0` (secondary accent)

### Typography
- **Sans**: Inter font family (primary)
- **Mono**: JetBrains Mono (code/technical content)

### Component Patterns
Components are organized by feature area:
- `components/layout/` - Header, Footer, Navigation
- `components/home/` - Homepage-specific components
- `components/common/` - Shared UI components
- `components/team/` - Team-specific components

## Important Configuration

### Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- Configured for image optimization with external domains
- Security headers for production deployment
- URL redirects for legacy routes (e.g., /blog â†’ /news)
- Image caching and CSP policies

### Deployment & Environment
- Deployed on Vercel with automatic builds
- Uses environment variables for site URL and analytics
- Static generation (SSG) for performance
- Image optimization enabled

## Development Guidelines

### Code Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing component patterns in `components/`
- Use Tailwind CSS classes, avoid custom CSS unless necessary
- Leverage existing utilities in `lib/utils.ts`

### Content Guidelines
- Team member content goes in appropriate subteam directory
- News articles should include proper frontmatter metadata
- Images should be optimized and use descriptive alt text
- Follow British English spelling conventions

### State Management
- No external state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- Content is fetched server-side using the content API functions
- Static generation is preferred for performance

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Content Types
1. Define TypeScript interface in `lib/types.ts`
2. Add fetching functions in `lib/content.ts`
3. Create components in appropriate `components/` subdirectory
4. Add CMS configuration in `public/admin/config.yml`

### Modifying Team Structure
- Team subteams are defined in the `getTeamMembers()` function
- Update the subteams array to add/remove team categories
- Ensure TypeScript types match in `lib/types.ts`

### Working with Images
- Place images in `public/images/`
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Configure external domains in `next.config.js` if needed
- Follow the image guidelines in the content guide

## Testing & Quality

### Linting & Type Checking
- ESLint configured with Next.js best practices
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` before commits

### Performance Considerations
- Static generation (SSG) is the default
- Images are optimized through Next.js Image component
- Content is cached and pre-generated at build time
- Aim for Lighthouse scores of 90+ across all metrics

### Accessibility
- Components follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Semantic HTML structure is maintained
- Images include proper alt text
- Color contrast meets accessibility standards
