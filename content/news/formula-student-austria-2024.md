Oxford University Racing delivered an outstanding performance at Formula Student Austria 2024, securing a top 10 finish in the overall competition. The event, held at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg, brought together over 100 teams from around the world to compete in various static and dynamic events.

## Competition Highlights

Our team excelled across multiple disciplines:

- **Technical Inspection**: Passed on the first attempt, demonstrating our meticulous preparation
- **Static Events**: Strong performances in Cost Report (8th place) and Business Presentation (12th place)
- **Dynamic Events**: Competitive times in Acceleration and Skid Pad events
- **Endurance**: Successfully completed the 22km endurance race

## Team Performance

The 2024 car, featuring significant aerodynamic improvements and a refined powertrain, proved its capabilities on the international stage. Our electronics package, developed entirely in-house, performed flawlessly throughout the competition weekend.

"This result is a testament to the hard work and dedication of every team member," said Team Principal Sarah Johnson. "We've made significant progress since last year, and this finish motivates us for the remaining competitions this season."

## Looking Ahead

The team will now focus on Formula Student UK, taking place at Silverstone Circuit in July. With valuable lessons learned from Austria, we're confident about delivering an even stronger performance on home soil.

Special thanks to our sponsors who made this competition possible, and to all the team members who traveled to Austria to support the car and drivers.
