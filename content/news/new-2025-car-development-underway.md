The Oxford University Racing team has begun development of our 2025 Formula Student car, with ambitious goals for improved performance and innovative engineering solutions. This year's design incorporates cutting-edge technologies and lessons learned from our successful 2024 campaign.

## Key Development Areas

### Aerodynamics
Our aerodynamics team is implementing advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to optimize the car's aerodynamic package. New wing designs and underbody concepts aim to reduce drag while maintaining downforce.

### Materials & Chassis
The chassis team is exploring lightweight composite materials and innovative manufacturing techniques. Finite element analysis is being used to optimize structural integrity while minimizing weight.

### Powertrain
The powertrain sub-team is developing an improved engine management system with enhanced fuel efficiency and power delivery. Integration with the electronics team ensures optimal performance.

## Timeline & Milestones

- **Q3 2024**: Design finalization and simulation phase
- **Q4 2024**: Manufacturing and initial testing
- **Q1 2025**: Integration and track testing
- **Q2 2025**: Competition preparation and final tuning

## Innovation Focus

This year's car will feature several innovative solutions:

1. **Sustainable Materials**: Incorporating bio-composite materials where possible
2. **Advanced Electronics**: New telemetry and data acquisition systems
3. **Energy Management**: Optimized power distribution and efficiency
4. **Manufacturing Techniques**: 3D printing applications for complex components

## Team Expansion

With increased complexity comes the need for more team members. We're actively recruiting students from all engineering disciplines to contribute to this exciting project.

The entire team is energized by the challenges ahead and committed to pushing the boundaries of Formula Student engineering.
