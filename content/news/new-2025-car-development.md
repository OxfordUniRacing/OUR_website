Oxford University Racing is excited to announce that development of our 2025 Formula Student car has officially begun. Following our successful 2024 season, the team is building on lessons learned to create what promises to be our most advanced vehicle yet.

## Design Philosophy

The 2025 car development focuses on three core principles:

1. **Weight Reduction**: Implementing advanced composite materials and optimized design
2. **Aerodynamic Efficiency**: Enhanced package based on extensive CFD analysis and wind tunnel testing
3. **Reliability**: Robust systems designed for consistent performance across all events

## Key Innovations

### Aerodynamics Team
- All-new front wing design with improved efficiency
- Revised undertray geometry for better ground effect
- Active aerodynamic elements being evaluated

### Chassis Team
- Carbon fiber monocoque construction
- 15% weight reduction target
- Improved driver ergonomics and safety systems

### Powertrain Team
- New engine mapping for better drivability
- Enhanced cooling systems
- Lightweight exhaust system design

### Electronics Team
- Advanced telemetry and data acquisition
- Driver display with real-time performance metrics
- Improved sensor integration

## Timeline and Milestones

- **October 2024**: Design freeze for major components
- **December 2024**: Manufacturing begins
- **March 2025**: First car assembly
- **April 2025**: Testing and validation
- **June 2025**: First competition
