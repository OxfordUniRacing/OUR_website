James is a third-year Engineering Science student at Trinity College, leading the aerodynamics sub-team. He specializes in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing, developing innovative aerodynamic solutions for our Formula Student cars.

Since joining the team, James has revolutionized our aerodynamic development process, implementing advanced simulation techniques and establishing partnerships with local wind tunnel facilities. His work has contributed to significant performance improvements in recent competitions.

James is particularly interested in the intersection of aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics, working closely with other sub-teams to optimize overall car performance. He has presented research on Formula Student aerodynamics at engineering conferences.

Outside of university and racing, James is an avid cyclist and rock climber. He aims to pursue a career in motorsport aerodynamics or automotive engineering after completing his degree.
