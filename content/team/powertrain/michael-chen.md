Michael is in his fourth year studying Mechanical Engineering at Christ Church, Oxford. As Powertrain Lead, he oversees engine development, transmission design, and vehicle dynamics optimization.

With three years of experience in the powertrain sub-team, Michael has led the development of increasingly sophisticated engine management systems and hybrid power solutions. His expertise spans internal combustion engines, electric motor integration, and energy management systems.

Michael's technical contributions have been crucial to the team's competitive success, particularly in endurance events where powertrain reliability is paramount. He mentors junior team members and coordinates with electronics engineers for integrated control systems.

Outside of Formula Student, Michael enjoys karting, mechanical design projects, and staying current with automotive technology trends. He plans to work in electric vehicle development after graduation.
