```
**Time**: 1 minute

### Step 4: Update DNS Records

#### Access DNS Management
1. **Login to Domain Registrar**
   - Go to your domain registrar's control panel
   - Navigate to DNS management section
   - Look for existing A and CNAME records

#### Update Records

# Use online DNS checkers
https://dnschecker.org/#A/oxforduniracing.com
https://dnschecker.org/#CNAME/www.oxforduniracing.com
```
**Expected**: DNS records point to Vercel endpoints
**Time**: 5-30 minutes for global propagation
